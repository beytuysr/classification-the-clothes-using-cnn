# classification the clothes using cnn

In this project, I tried to classify clothes, using 255 pixel.Also, I used keras model when I predict the classes of clothes. Our data has 10 different clothes classes and finally, we can see the precison, recall and f1 score all classes.


#Remember the 10 classes decoding is as follows:
# 0=> T-shirt
# 1=> Trouser
# 2=> Pullover
# 3=> Dress
# 4=> Coat
# 5=> Sandal
# 6=> Shirt
# 7=> Sneaker
# 8=> Bag
# 9=> Ankle boat
